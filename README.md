# Meta-Ads-Analysis-Supplement-Brand
This project showcases how raw digital advertising data can be transformed into clear, actionable insights using Python, SQL, Power BI, and AI-assisted analytics. It originated from a client proposal that didn’t move forward, so the concept was developed into a full portfolio demonstration of data-driven marketing intelligence.

## Project Goal
The customer faced critical challenges with inefficient budget allocation, limited strategic focus on high-value customers, and difficulty identifying long-term performance trends. Meta’s fragmented and user-unfriendly platform compounded these issues, requiring manual calculations of key metrics like Break-even ROAS and Profit. This highlighted the need for a unified, on-brand BI solution to create a single source of truth.?

## Solution Overview
The solution centered on transforming Meta’s fragmented analytics into a unified and intelligent BI ecosystem. Meta data feeds were integrated through a streamlined ETL process, then structured into a robust and scalable data model.

From this foundation, two key outputs were delivered:

1. Power BI Dashboard – an on-brand, consolidated analytics experience providing real-time visibility, intuitive exploration, and a single source of truth.
2. AI-Generated Report – an automated, narrative-style insights report that detects trends, highlights performance drivers, and eliminates manual analysis and write-ups.

## Collection
Dummy data was created based on the structure of a Meta Ads Library export for a fictitious supplement brand. This dataset mirrors the fields, formats, and relationships typically found in a real Meta export, ensuring realistic testing and development conditions.
