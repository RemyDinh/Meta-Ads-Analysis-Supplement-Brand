# Meta-Ads-Analysis-Supplement-Brand
This project showcases how raw digital advertising data can be transformed into clear, actionable insights using Python, SQL, Power BI, and AI-assisted analytics. It originated from a client proposal that didn’t move forward, so the concept was developed into a full portfolio demonstration of data-driven marketing intelligence.

## Project Goal
The customer faced critical issues including inefficient budget allocation, lack of strategic customer focus, and an inability to spot long-term performance trends. Their primary frustration stemmed from Meta's fragmented and user-unfriendly platform, which forced manual calculation of key metrics like Break-even ROAS and Profit. This created a strong need for an on-brand, consolidated BI experience to establish a single source of truth.

From this foundation, two key outputs were delivered:

1. Power BI Dashboard – an on-brand, consolidated analytics experience providing real-time visibility, intuitive exploration, and a single source of truth.
2. AI-Generated Report – an automated, narrative-style insights report that detects trends, highlights performance drivers, and eliminates manual analysis and write-ups.
   
## Solution Overview
The solution centered on transforming Meta’s fragmented analytics into a unified and intelligent BI ecosystem. Meta data feeds were integrated through a streamlined ETL process, then structured into a robust and scalable data model.
