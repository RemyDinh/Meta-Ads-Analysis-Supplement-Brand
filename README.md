# Meta-Ads-Analysis-Supplement-Brand
This project showcases how raw digital advertising data can be transformed into clear, actionable insights using Python, SQL, Power BI, and AI-assisted analytics. It originated from a client proposal that didn’t move forward, so the concept was developed into a full portfolio demonstration of data-driven marketing intelligence.

## Project Goal
The customer faced significant challenges, including inefficient budget allocation, limited strategic focus on high-value customers, and difficulty identifying long-term performance trends. These issues were compounded by Meta’s fragmented and unintuitive platform, which forced internal analysts to rely on manual calculations and produce slow, inconsistent reports. This underscored the need for a unified, on-brand BI solution that could serve as a single source of truth.

After asking further clarifying questions to key stakeholders, the following primary research questions were identified that the BI solution should address:

- Which campaigns, ad sets, or ads generate the highest revenue and profit?
- Which ads are underperforming relative to spend?
- How do performance metrics evolve over time (daily, weekly, monthly)?
- Which countries, age groups, or genders respond best to specific campaigns?
- hat strategies can scale high-performing ads or reallocate budget effectively?

## Solution Overview
The solution focused on transforming Meta’s fragmented analytics into a unified and intelligent BI ecosystem. Meta data feeds were integrated through a streamlined ETL process and structured into a robust, scalable data model.

From this foundation, a key output was delivered:

Power BI Dashboard – an on-brand, consolidated analytics experience that provides real-time visibility, intuitive exploration, and a single source of truth, eliminating the need for manual calculations and inconsistent reporting.

## 1. Data Collection
Dummy data was created based on the structure of a Meta Ads Library export for a fictitious supplement brand. This dataset mirrors the fields, formats, and relationships typically found in a real Meta export, ensuring realistic testing and development conditions. LINK
