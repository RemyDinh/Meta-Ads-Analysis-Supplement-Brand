# Meta Ads Analysis - Supps&
This project showcases how raw digital advertising data can be transformed into clear, actionable insights using Python, SQL, Power BI. It originated from a client proposal that didn’t move forward, so the concept was developed into a full portfolio demonstration of data-driven marketing intelligence based on a fictive supplement company.

## Project Goal
The customer faced significant challenges, including inefficient budget allocation, limited strategic focus on high-value customers, and difficulty identifying long-term performance trends. These issues were compounded by Meta’s fragmented and unintuitive platform, which forced internal analysts to rely on manual calculations and produce slow, inconsistent reports. This underscored the need for a unified, on-brand BI solution that could serve as a single source of truth.

After asking further clarifying questions to key stakeholders, the following primary research questions were identified that the BI solution should address:

- Which campaigns, ad sets, or ads generate the highest revenue and profit?
- Which ads are underperforming relative to spend?
- How do performance metrics evolve over time (daily, weekly, monthly)?
- Which countries, age groups, or genders respond best to specific campaigns?
- hat strategies can scale high-performing ads or reallocate budget effectively?

## Solution Overview
The solution aimed to transform Meta’s fragmented analytics into a unified, intelligent BI ecosystem by integrating data feeds through a streamlined ETL process and structuring them into a robust, scalable data model, resulting in a Power BI dashboard—an on-brand, consolidated analytics platform that delivers real-time visibility, intuitive exploration, and a single source of truth, eliminates manual calculations and inconsistent reporting, and provides a solid foundation to address the key questions identified by stakeholders.

## 1. Data Collection
Dummy data was created based on the structure of a Meta Ads Manager export for a fictitious supplement brand. This dataset mirrors the fields, formats, and relationships typically found in a real Meta export, ensuring realistic testing and development conditions. LINK
